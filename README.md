I'm a Computer Science student with a deep passion for Generative AI. I specialize in building intelligent and autonomous systems, from sophisticated agentic workflows to multimodal applications that bridge the gap between language and vision. I enjoy architecting and optimizing AI solutions, with a strong focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM fine-tuning.
